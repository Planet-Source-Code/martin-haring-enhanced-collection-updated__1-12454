An enhanced collection

This enhanced collection adds the following facilities to the existing 
collection object:

1.   Contains not only the data but the keys for the data
2.   An Exists function to determine if the data for a key exists in the collection.
3.   A Key function to get the key for a data item. Allows you to iterate through
	the collection obtaining first the key and then the data
4.   Can be used in earlier versions of VB where the collection object is available.
5.   Now you can use the "for each xxx in mhCollection" to iterate for the data

Enjoy.
